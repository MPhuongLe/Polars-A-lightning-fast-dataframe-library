Updated: May 20, 2024

## Introduction

This is our teamwork for the Intelligent Data Analysis course, where we introduce POLARS, a revolutionary dataframe library designed for exceptional speed and efficiency. 

## Contents

### Understanding POLARS
We'll unveil the story of POLARS, highlighting the key design decisions that propel it beyond Pandas in terms of speed and performance, and finally the drawbacks of Polars as well. These are covered in the `slide` directory.

### POLARS Tutorial 
Dive into a practical guide to POLARS syntax (we also provide the comparisons with familiar Pandas syntax). Check the `tutorial` directory.

### Performance Comparison
We present **detailed** experiments that showcase Polars' speed advantage over Pandas in the `slide` directory. The result comparative graphs are included in the slides as well.

### One Billion Row Challenge 
Witness the power of POLARS firsthand as we tackle the challenge of reading a one-billion-row file and efficiently calculating min, max, and mean values. See the `1brc` directory for details if you are interested.
